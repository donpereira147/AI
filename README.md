Inteligent Agents

This assignment consisted of managing a sharing bycicles system, using Java, JADE and JESS, where the system is able to realize the stations that are full and the stations that need bycicles and able to deal with these problems offering rewards to the clients. In the end, the program shows the statistics of all the stations, so that they can be analysed.

The main focus of this project was to learn how to work with intelligent agents and their communications.
